\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}

This manual describes the IPA CANopen library, a C++ framework for communicating with CANopen motor devices. Most users will use the ROS (Robot Operating System) wrapper provided as part of the package. However, the library itself is completely independent from ROS and therefore can also be used in other contexts.

The library and examples can be found in the following github repositories:
\begin{itemize}
\item \url{https://github.com/ipa320/ipa_canopen}
\item \url{https://github.com/ipa320/ipa_canopen_tutorials}
\end{itemize}

In Section \ref{chap:installation}, a step-by-step guide to installing the library is given. Command-line tools for moving and referencing CANopen-enabled modules are described in Section \ref{chap:tools}. The control of CANopen modules from ROS is explained in Section \ref{chap:roscanopen}. Finally, in Section \ref{chap:extending}, we show how to use and extend the library independently from ROS.
