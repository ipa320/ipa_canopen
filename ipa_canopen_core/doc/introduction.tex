\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}

This manual describes the IPA CANopen library, a C++ framework for communicating with CANopen motor devices. Most users will use the ROS (Robot Operating System) wrapper provided as part of the package. However, the library itself is completely independent from ROS and therefore can also be used in other contexts.

In Chapter \ref{chap:installation}, a step-by-step guide to installating the library is given. Command-line tools for moving and referencing modules are described in \ref{chap:tools}. The use of CANopen devices from ROS is explained in \ref{chap:roscanopen}. Finally, in Chapter \ref{chap:extending}, we show how to use the library in own C++ projects, and how to adapt it to a user's needs.
